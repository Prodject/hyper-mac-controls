### Install

**Hyper store**:  
Install using `hyper i hyper-mac-controls`

**Manually**:  
1. Open Hyper preferences (or edit them manually at `~/.hyper.js`  with your editor).
2. Update your list of plugins to include hyper-arc-dark-controls, like so:
```javascript
plugins: [
	'hyper-hyper-mac-controls'
],
```
3. Reload (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) or restart Hyper

### Config

Currently there are no config options. It makes use of `showWindowControls` to determine where to place the controls.

### Changelog
**1.1.0**
- Update to work with Hyper 2.0
- Remove flipped versions (they are on my todo)
- Remove package specific config options and make use of `showWindowControls` instead.

**1.0.4**
- Add left and right-flipped options
